# My Analysis on Top 50 YouTubers - In Depth

---

This section outlines the analysis process, where I conclude my analysis based on data visualizations created in Python using Jupyter Notebook as my IDE. If you rather to see a code readability + data visualizations without my analysis only, please refer to [youtube.ipynb](https://github.com/erickarambulo/youtube/blob/main/youtube.ipynb).

### Data Visualizations and Analysis:

- Ranking of Top 50 YouTube Channels

This is a general bar chart of popular YouTube channels by subscriber counts. MrBeast has consistently held the top position for a significant period. I also observed that T-Series is the largest music record label in India, and its popularity is steadily increasing. I predict that T-Series will eventually surpass MrBeast, given the significantly larger population of India (1.43 billion) compared to the United States (335 million). I am confident that T-Series will overtake MrBeast in the near future.

- Subscriber Demographics by Country and Category:

The Top 50 list appears to be ranked by subscriber count per country, with India at the top and the United States in second place. As mentioned earlier, India has a very large population of people .

Entertainment is highly prevalent among the top 50 YouTubers. Music ranks second, followed by education.

The entertainment category broadly appeals to audiences of all ages, captivated by engaging video edits, gaming content, and more.

The music category's presence in the top three is unsurprising, as many viewers enjoy watching music videos of their favorite artists.

Finally, education occupies the third position, reflecting the desire of some viewers to learn from YouTubers on diverse subjects and stay informed.

- Sum of Subscribers for Demographics of YouTubers' Nationality

It's **crucial** to distinguish between a YouTuber's country and nationality. The country refers to the nation where the YouTuber currently resides or operates. In contrast, nationality indicates the country of the YouTuber's origin or ancestry. This bar chart indicates that Indian, American, and South Korean YouTubers have the highest subscriber counts.

- Content Language vs. Popularity:

The chart above demonstrates a **crucial** point for YouTubers and data analysts alike: increasing subscriber count often correlates with offering subtitles in popular languages. To expand their reach, YouTubers can either add subtitles in languages like Hindi, Korean, and others to attract specific audiences or learn to speak these languages themselves. This strategy allows them to connect with viewers from countries where English is not the primary language, ultimately contributing to subscriber growth.

- Brand vs. Individual Channels:

This note is crucial to consider. When comparing brand channels to individual creator channels based on subscriber count and engagement among the top 50 YouTubers, 29 were brand channels ("Yes"), while 21 were individual creator channels ("No"). This demonstrates a significant prevalence of brand channels among the top 50.

If the distribution were equal (25 brand channels and 25 individual creator channels), the chart would likely be more balanced. However, the observed disparity suggests that brand channels may have a higher likelihood of achieving top-tier success on YouTube.
