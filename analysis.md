---

This section outlines the analysis process, where I conclude my analysis based on data visualizations created in Python using Jupyter Notebook as my IDE. If you rather to see a code readability + data visualizations without my analysis only, please refer to [youtube.ipynb](https://github.com/erickarambulo/youtube/blob/main/youtube.ipynb).

This is a general bar chart of popular YouTube channels by subscriber counts. MrBeast has consistently held the top position for a significant period. I also observed that T-Series is the largest music record label in India, and its popularity is steadily increasing. I predict that T-Series will eventually surpass MrBeast, given the significantly larger population of India (1.43 billion) compared to the United States (335 million). I am confident that T-Series will overtake MrBeast in the near future.

Entertainment is highly prevalent among the top 50 YouTubers. Music ranks second, followed by education.

The entertainment category broadly appeals to audiences of all ages, captivated by engaging video edits, gaming content, and more.

The music category's presence in the top three is unsurprising, as many viewers enjoy watching music videos of their favorite artists.

Finally, education occupies the third position, reflecting the desire of some viewers to learn from YouTubers on diverse subjects and stay informed.
