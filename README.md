# Project: Top 50 YouTube Channels - In Depth Analysis

Hey, welcome programmers, data analysts, readers, stakeholders, or anyone else! Thanks for visiting this page! This project is relatively small. However, I believe that gaining deeper insights from even small projects will significantly enhance my ability to identify key details within larger, more complex contexts.

I obtained a YouTube [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashminslnk/youtube-subscribers-data-2024) from Kaggle.com. I chose this dataset over others because most YouTube datasets are outdated and infrequently updated. This particular dataset, however, was updated just a month ago!

Project Goals:

- Perform a little bit of data cleaning since it's only 50 rows âœ”
-
