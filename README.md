# Project: Top 50 YouTube Channels - In Depth Analysis

Hey, welcome programmers, data analysts, readers, stakeholders, or anyone else! Thanks for visiting this page! This project is relatively small. However, I believe that gaining deeper insights from even small projects will significantly enhance my ability to identify key details within larger, more complex contexts.

I obtained a YouTube [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashminslnk/youtube-subscribers-data-2024) from Kaggle.com. I chose this dataset over others because most YouTube datasets are outdated and infrequently updated. This particular dataset, however, was updated just a month ago!

Project Goals:

Google Sheets:
- Perform a little bit of data cleaning on Google Sheets instead of SQL since it's only 50 rows ✔
- Save as a .csv file and then use Python with Jupyter Notebook as an IDE for further analysis ✔

Python in Jupyter Notebook:
- Subscriber Demographics by Country and Category: Explore which countries have the most popular channels and how those rankings differ by category (e.g., gaming, music, education).
- Top Channel Growth: Identify the channels that have seen the most significant subscriber growth over a specific period. This could be insightful for understanding what kind of content resonates most with viewers.
- Content Language vs. Popularity: Analyze if there's a correlation between the primary language of a channel and its subscriber base. This might reveal opportunities for multilingual content creators.
- Brand vs. Individual Channels: Compare how brand channels perform against individual creator channels in terms of subscriber count and engagement.
- Category Saturation: Explore which content categories are the most saturated and identify potential niche areas with lower competition.

Check out the file, [documentation.md](https://github.com/erickarambulo/youtube/blob/main/documentation.md), to see my changes on Google Sheets from the original sheet to the updated sheet.

Also, there is another file called [analysis.md](https://github.com/erickarambulo/youtube/blob/main/analysis.md). This file focuses on data visualizations that also includes my analysis.

Lastly, if you want to see a readability code that focuses on creating data visualizations without analysis, please refer to [youtube.ipynb](https://github.com/erickarambulo/youtube/blob/main/youtube.ipynb).

Once again, thank you so much for visiting this page! I hope you enjoy finding a few useful insights!
