# Google Sheets Documentation

This documentation page will solely focus on keep tracking my changes that I made to spreadsheet. This will help me to make good habits of practicing my documentations for future employers; therefore, that way they will be able to keep tracking on the modifications I have made to Google Sheets.

I obtained my [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashminslnk/youtube-subscribers-data-2024) from Kaggle.com. It contains 50 rows + 1 header and 6 columns. I decided to use this dataset because it was recently most updated by a month ago.

Here is my updated [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iU5AqJhoyd4ypMkamjDsyWFWF5B1aEMLNiSBFzdZGKg/edit?gid=618659102#gid=618659102), which come in two separate sheets: original and updated.

## Changes That I Made

**NOTE:** According to Wikipedia page called [List of most-subscribed YouTube channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels), This website is updated in real-time, so the number of subscribers (millions) column is always changing based on real-time data.

- I **updated** my dataset by changing the 'number of subscribers' column for all 50 rows. I referenced the Wikipedia page to ensure that the numbers in my spreadsheet align with the data on Wikipedia.
- I noticed that there is a symbol [a] next to Cpyrus like this "Cyprus[a]" so I removed it and leave it as "Cyprus".
- I removed some rows that contain whitespaces by clicking Data -> Data cleanup -> Trim whitespace
- Name of channel called **Like Nastya** with a column **Country** was United States, Ukraine. **Like Nastya** is not from Ukraine. The channel is from Russia but eventually she moved to Miami, Flordia; therefore, I fixed it to "United States, Russia"
